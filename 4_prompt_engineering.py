# Prompt Engineering

# There are many ways to prompt a Large Language Model (LLM).
# The most common way is to use a natural language prompt,
# but there are other approaches such as structured prompts or few-shot prompts.

# Different types of prompts:

# 1. Direct Prompt:
#    Example: "What is the capital of France?"

# 2. Open-ended Prompt:
#    Example: "Tell me about the capital of France."

# 3. Instruction Prompt:
#    Example: "Explain the capital of France in detail."

# 4. Few-shot Prompt:
#    Example: "Translate the following sentences to French: 'Hello', 'Goodbye'."

# 5. Role Prompt:
#    Example: "You are a travel guide. Describe the capital of France."

# 6. Chain of Thought Prompt:
#    Example: "First, think about the geography of France. Then, consider its history. Finally, describe the capital."

# Principles of Prompt Engineering:
# 1. Clarity: The prompt should be clear and unambiguous.
# 2. Specificity: The prompt should be specific enough to guide the model's response.
# 3. Context: Provide enough context for the model to understand the task.
# 4. Examples: Use examples to guide the model's response, especially in few-shot prompting.
# 5. Iteration: Experiment with different prompts and refine them based on the model's responses.
# 6. Feedback: Use feedback from the model's responses to improve the prompt.
# 7. Length: Keep prompts concise but informative; avoid unnecessary complexity.
# 8. Format: Consider the format of the response you want and structure the prompt accordingly.
# 9. Role Definition: Clearly define the role or persona you want the model to adopt.
# 10. Avoid Bias: Be aware of potential biases in the prompt and strive for neutrality.
